### Summary ###

The purpose of these documents are to be a complete reference describing how to
communicate with and within the Astron cluster. At the heart of every Astron
cluster is a backbone consisting of one or more "Message Directors" which route
messages between the various nodes in the cluster. These documents describe the
exact protocol used by the MDs to communicate, as well as the various types of
messages that one can expect to see in a working Astron environment.
