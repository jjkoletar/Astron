Astron Coding Style Guidelines
------------------------------
Code and documentation in the master & release branches should conform to Astron's style guidelines.
This means that code should be formatted properly before being submitted in a pull request.
Naturally, it is ideal to keep a consistent style even before making a pull request.
Additionally, like all style guides, don't blindly follow the guide into making code unreadable.

**Python**  
For python use PEP-8 style guidelines.

**C/C++**
For C and C++ code refer to the 'cxx-style.md' document.
